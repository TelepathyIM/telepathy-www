## Description

Mission Control - or MC for short - is a Telepathy component implementing both the [Account Manager](http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/spec/Account_Manager.html) and [Channel Dispatcher](http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/spec/Channel_Dispatcher.html) specifications. It stores your IM account settings, deals with talking to the relevant connection managers to bring accounts online where necessary, and dispatches incoming and outgoing communication channels to the relevant applications.
