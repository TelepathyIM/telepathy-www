## Description

telepathy-nonsense is a connection manager for XMPP (Jabber), based on
[Telepathy Qt](/components/telepathy-qt) and the [QXmpp](https://github.com/qxmpp-project/qxmpp)
library.

Compared to [Telepathy Gabble](/components/telepathy-gabble), it is still not as mature
and feature-full as gabble, so gabble is the recommended connection manager for XMPP.
