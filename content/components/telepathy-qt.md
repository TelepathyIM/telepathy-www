## Description

The telepathy-qt library is a C++/Qt-based binding for the Telepathy D-Bus API. It may be used by client applications as well as connection managers, although connection manager support is not yet fully complete. Currently it is used by [KDE-Telepathy](https://community.kde.org/KTp) and a couple of experimental connection managers.
