title: Review procedure

All patches to Telepathy components are reviewed by (hopefully) more experienced developers of the components to ensure that they meet standards of code quality, understandability and maintainability.

## Procedure

* Record your changes in a Git branch.
* Publish your branch online somewhere; you can [request a freedesktop.org account](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/AccountRequests), or you can use your own webspace or any public git hosting site (github, gitlab, etc.).
* Ping a reviewer with your branch URL, either on IRC, or by e-mail to the mailing list, or in a bug with the `patch` keyword **(using a bug is generally recommended)**.
* The reviewer may ask you some questions and ask you to make some changes to your patch. When they approve it, you can commit it if you have access, or the reviewer may commit it for you.
